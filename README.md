# Data Visualization Dashboard for Inventory Management 

Divided into the following three parts

1. Geolocation showing information about Inventory order

The coloured markers on the map in Fig indicate the following :
  * Green Marker - If the order is Dispatched as well as Shipped
  * Yellow Marker - If the order is Dispatched and not Shipped
  * Red Marker - If the order is neither Dispatched nor Shipped

When you click on the marker of the city, you will see the Order ID, Dispatched Status and the Shipped Status of the order as well as the City name will be shown.

2. Table showing the live status of the orders in the dashboard, including their information.

3. Graph showing the status of time taken for each order.
